# Data-Mining
The codes for my data mining course

<b>Homework 1:</b> 

Working with the datset of Covid_19 patients.

<b>Homework 2:</b>

3 implementations, including:
  1. implementation 1: K-means clustering algorithm
  2. implementation 2: finding the spread of Covid-19 in a country (Iran) and cluster the highest outbreak cities on the map, using DBSCAN   clustering algorithm
  3. implementation 3: Image compression, using K-means clustering algorithm
  
 <b>Homework 3:</b>
 
 3 implementations, including:
  1. implementation 1: Decision Tree on heart.csv dataset to predict whether a person has a heart problem or not based on medical experiments
  2. implementation 2: Decision Tree with Weka 
  3. implementation 3: Na√Øve Bayes Text Classification, on Amazon book reviews, without using the pre-defined Naive Bayesian method, and instead by calculating words' frequency probabilities. (Bag of Words Model) This code combines <strong>NLP</strong>, <strong>Sentimental Analysis</strong>, and <strong>Opinion Mining</strong>.
